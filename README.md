While using the [Docker-OSX](https://github.com/sickcodes/Docker-OSX) (All credits goes to them), I try to come up with a solution that will allow rapidly implementing this into a software development environment, to consume less time while trying to deploy it.

As said, all the credit for the original tool goes to the Docker-OSX team and their amazing contributions.
